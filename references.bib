	abstract = {Der Deutsche Orden, auch Deutschherrenorden, Deutschritterorden oder Deutschorden genannt, ist eine römisch-katholische Ordensgemeinschaft. Mit dem Malteserorden steht er in der (Rechts-)Nachfolge der Ritterorden aus der Zeit der Kreuzzüge. Die Mitglieder des Ordens sind seit der Reform der Ordensregel 1929 regulierte Chorherren. Der Orden hat etwa 1000 Mitglieder (Stand: 2018), darunter 100 Priester und 200 Ordensschwestern, die sich vorwiegend karitativen Aufgaben widmen. Der Hauptsitz befindet sich heute in Wien.
Der vollständige Name lautet Orden der Brüder vom Deutschen Hospital Sankt Mariens in Jerusalem, lateinisch Ordo fratrum domus hospitalis Sanctae Mariae Teutonicorum Ierosolimitanorum. Aus der lateinischen Kurzbezeichnung Ordo Theutonicorum bzw. Ordo Teutonicus leitet sich das Ordenskürzel OT ab.
Die Ursprünge des Ordens liegen in einem Feldhospital bremischer und lübischer Kaufleute während des Dritten Kreuzzuges um 1190 im Heiligen Land bei der Belagerung der Stadt Akkon. Papst Innozenz III. bestätigte am 19. Februar 1199 die Umwandlung der Spitalgemeinschaft in einen Ritterorden und die Verleihung der Johanniter- und Templerregel für die Brüder vom Deutschen Haus St. Mariens in Jerusalem. Nach der Erhebung der Spitalgemeinschaft zum geistlichen Ritterorden engagierten sich die Mitglieder der ursprünglich karitativen Gemeinschaft während des 13. Jahrhunderts im Heiligen Römischen Reich, im Heiligen Land, dem mediterranen Raum sowie in Siebenbürgen und beteiligten sich an der deutschen Ostkolonisation. Das führte zu einer Reihe von Niederlassungen mit mehr oder weniger langem Bestehen. Eine zentrale Rolle spielte ab dem Ende des 13. Jahrhunderts der im Baltikum begründete Deutschordensstaat. Er umfasste am Ende des 14. Jahrhunderts ein Gebiet von rund 200.000 Quadratkilometern.Durch die schwere militärische Niederlage bei Tannenberg im Sommer 1410 gegen die Polnisch-Litauische Union sowie einen langwierigen Konflikt mit den preußischen Ständen in der Mitte des 15. Jahrhunderts beschleunigte sich der um 1400 einsetzende Niedergang sowohl des Ordens als auch seines Staatswesens. Infolge der Säkularisation des verbliebenen Ordensstaates im Zuge der Reformation im Jahre 1525 und seiner Umwandlung in ein weltliches Herzogtum übte der Orden in Preußen und nach 1561 in Livland keinen nennenswerten Einfluss mehr aus. Er bestand jedoch im Heiligen Römischen Reich mit erheblichem Grundbesitz fort, vor allem in Süddeutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz.
Nach linksrheinischen Gebietsverlusten im späten 18. Jahrhundert infolge der Koalitionskriege und nach der Säkularisation in den Rheinbundstaaten zu Beginn des 19. Jahrhunderts blieben nur noch die Besitzungen im Kaisertum Österreich. Mit dem Zerfall der Habsburger Donaumonarchie und dem österreichischen Adelsaufhebungsgesetz nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg vom April 1919 ging neben dem Verlust erheblicher Besitztümer auch die ritterliche Komponente in der Ordensstruktur verloren. Seit 1929 wird der Orden von Ordenspriestern geleitet und somit nach kanonischem Recht in der Form eines klerikalen Ordens geführt.Die geschichtswissenschaftliche Rezeption befasste sich im 19. und in der ersten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts zumeist nur mit der Präsenz des damaligen Ritterordens im Baltikum – der Deutschordensstaat wurde mit dem Orden selbst gleichgesetzt. Erforschung und Interpretation der Ordensgeschichte waren dabei in Deutschland, Polen und Russland extrem unterschiedlich, stark national oder sogar nationalistisch geprägt. Eine methodische Aufarbeitung von Geschichte und Strukturen des Ordens setzte international erst nach 1945 ein.},

Prussia grew about rapidly in the 18th and 19th centuries and formed the basis of the German Empire in 1871. The empire would survive until 1918 when it was defeated in World War I.
After 1900 Berlin became a major world city, known for its leadership roles in science, the humanities, music, museums, higher education, government, diplomacy and military affairs. It also had a role in manufacturing and finance.
During World War II, bombing, artillery, and ferocious street-by-street fighting destroyed large parts of Berlin. Berlin was subsequently divided among the four major Allied powers and for over four decades it encapsulated the Cold War confrontation between West and East.  With the reunification of Germany in 1990, Berlin was restored as the capital and as a major world city.},

	abstract = {Hohenzollern Castle (German: Burg Hohenzollern [bʊʁk hoːənˈtsɔlɐn] (listen)) is the ancestral seat of the imperial House of Hohenzollern. The third of three hilltop castles built on the site, it is located atop Mount Hohenzollern, above and south of Hechingen, on the edge of the Swabian Jura of central Baden-Württemberg, Germany.
The first castle on the mountain was constructed in the early 11th century. Over the years the House of Hohenzollern split several times, but the castle remained in the Swabian branch, the dynastic seniors of the Franconian-Brandenburgian cadet branch that later acquired its own imperial throne. This castle was completely destroyed in 1423 after a ten-month siege by the free imperial cities of Swabia.
The second castle, a larger and sturdier structure, was constructed from 1454 to 1461, and served as a refuge for the Catholic Swabian Hohenzollerns, including during the Thirty Years' War. By the end of the 18th century it was thought to have lost its strategic importance and gradually fell into disrepair, leading to the demolition of several dilapidated buildings.
The third, and current, castle was built between 1846 and 1867 as a family memorial by Hohenzollern scion King Frederick William IV of Prussia. Architect Friedrich August Stüler based his design on English Gothic Revival architecture and the Châteaux of the Loire Valley. No member of the Hohenzollern family was in permanent or regular residence when it was completed, and none of the three German Emperors of the late 19th and early 20th century German Empire ever occupied the castle; in 1945 it briefly became the home of the former Crown Prince Wilhelm of Germany, son of the last Hohenzollern monarch, Kaiser Wilhelm II.
Among the historical artifacts of Prussian history contained in the castle are the Crown of Wilhelm II, some of the personal effects of King Frederick the Great, and a letter from US President George Washington thanking Hohenzollern relative Baron von Steuben for his service in the American Revolutionary War.},

The bear, which occupies a large part of the Berlin coat of arms, is a very important figure. There is a theory that the black bear was added to Berlin's national symbol in tribute to Margrave Albrecht the First (Albrecht I). According to another version, the bear on the coat of arms is the animal whose roar makes up the first syllable in the name of the city of Berlin, "Bär". Originally in 1280 the coat of arms depicted a brown bear, a black bear, an eagle and the margrave's helmet.

	abstract = {Have you heard of Berlin's newest tourist attraction? It's the Humboldt Forum right in the heart of the German capital. With high-profile exhibitions around art and culture, it aims to be a place for discussion and exchange. But the prestigious building in the reconstructed Berlin Palace has itself been the subject of controversy from the start. Not least because art from former colonies in Africa is on display. DW's Hannah Hummel checks out the Humboldt Forum to see whether is worth a visit. We can tell you one thing in advance: The great view from the roof terrace is a must-see.

	shorttitle = {Germany and the {Holy} {Roman} {Empire}},
	abstract = {Germany and the Holy Roman Empire offers a new interpretation of the development of German-speaking central Europe and the Holy Roman Empire or German Reich, from the great reforms of 1495-1500 to its dissolution in 1806 after the turmoil of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Going against the notion that this was a long period of decline, Joachim Whaley shows how imperial institutions developed in response to the crises of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, notably the Reformation and Thirty Years War, and assesses the impact of international developments on the Reich. Central themes are the tension between Habsburg aspirations to create a German monarchy and the desire of the German princes and cities to maintain their traditional rights, and how the Reich developed the functions of a state during this period. The first single-author account of German history from the Reformation to the early nineteenth century since Hajo Holborn's study written in the 1950s, it also illuminates the development of the German territories subordinate to the Reich. Whaley explores the implications of the Reformation and subsequent religious reform movements, both Protestant and Catholic, and the Enlightenment for the government of both secular and ecclesiastical principalities, the minor territories of counts and knights and the cities. The Reich and the territories formed a coherent and workable system and, as a polity, the Reich developed its own distinctive political culture and traditions of German patriotism over the early modern period. Whaley explains the development of the Holy Roman Empire as an early modern polity and illuminates the evolution of the several hundred German territories within it. He gives a rich account of topics such as the Reformation, the Thirty Years War, Pietism and baroque Catholicism, the Aufklärung or German Enlightenment and the impact on the Empire and its territories of the French Revolution and Napoleon. It includes consideration of language, cultural aspects and religious and intellectual movements. Germany and the Holy Roman Empire engages with all the major debates among both German and English-speaking historians about early modern German history over the last sixty years and offers a striking new interpretation of this important period. Volume I extends from the late fifteenth century through to the Thirty Years War.},

	annote = {German margraves, also known as Margraves of the Holy Roman Empire, were feudal rulers who held the rank of a margrave (or margravine in the case of female rulers). The title of margrave was used to denote a noble who governed a border territory or a march (Mark in German), which was a region on the outskirts of the empire, often characterized by military significance.
Margraves were appointed by the Holy Roman Emperor to administer and protect the frontier regions of the empire. They held significant authority and were responsible for maintaining order, defending the borders, and promoting the economic and social development of their territories.
The specific powers and responsibilities of margraves varied over time and depended on the specific circumstances and agreements between the emperor and the margrave. Some margraves ruled over territories that were part of a larger duchy or principality, while others governed semi-autonomous regions directly under imperial authority.
In the context of Brandenburg, the Margraviate of Brandenburg was ruled by a series of margraves who played a crucial role in its development. The House of Ascania and later the House of Hohenzollern were prominent dynasties that held the title of margrave in Brandenburg, eventually leading to the establishment of the Kingdom of Prussia.

The Old Prussians, who spoke an Indo-European language now known as Old Prussian and worshipped pre-Christian deities, lent their name, despite very few commonalities, to the later, predominantly Low German-speaking inhabitants of the region.The duchy of the Polans under Mieszko I, which was the predecessor of the Kingdom of Poland, first attempted to conquer and baptize the Baltic tribes during the 10th century, but repeatedly encountered strong resistance. Not until the 13th century were the Old Prussians subjugated and their lands conquered by the Teutonic Order. The remaining Old Prussians were assimilated during the following two centuries. The old Prussian language, largely undocumented, was effectively extinct by the 17th century.The original territory of the Old Prussians prior to the first clashes with the Polans consisted of central and southern West and East Prussia, equivalent to parts of the modern areas of the Pomeranian Voivodeship and Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship in Poland, the Kaliningrad Oblast in Russia and the southern Klaipėda Region in Lithuania. The territory was also inhabited by Scalovians, a tribe related to the Prussians, Curonians and Eastern Balts.},
